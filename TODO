principe: need to handle ints, ints > 32bits, and floats correctly
when sending them to tyrant (dig into TC code to see if this will
require the client to know the server's endianness).
principe: need to test against fixed-length TT databases.
principe: add edoc info.

principe_table: need to handle floats as a column value type
principe_table: need to encode floats/ints/bigints correctly
principe_table: add edoc info.
principe_table: schema converter? a fun that you pass in (perhaps
as a module parameter) which automatically performs input/output
type conversion for column values and will convert column keys to
atoms.

general: need a simple gen_server connection handler
