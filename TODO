use multiple query expression args

principe_table: schema converter? a fun that you pass in (perhaps
as a module parameter) which automatically performs input/output
type conversion for column values and will convert column keys to
atoms.

medici: need to flesh-out/test support for running multiple medici
instances (e.g. one for tyrant server A and one for tyrant server B)

medici: add support for running the tyrant server directly within medici
(as a port, with tyrant stdio logging going to the erlang logging facilities).
