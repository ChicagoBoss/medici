This is a thin Erlang wrapper around the Tokyo Tyrant TCP/IP API.

I have tried to keep this as simple as possible for the moment.

There is no connection pooling or connection handling.  If you want it, 
do it yourself.  The app developer will have a better idea of what they
might need or want.  In fact, it does not really do any connection bits
at all (although it does provide a helper function to set up the connection
for you) and you are required to pass in the socket to the Tyrant server
for every function.

Keys must be binaries, values can be anything.

Mad props to Bob Ippolito for the pytyrant package that I used as a
template and to Harish Mallipeddi whose tora package provided the
response handling functions I am using.  If you are looking for a
Tyrant interface that is more of a traditional DB access system then
give tora (http://github.com/mallipeddi/tora) a try.
